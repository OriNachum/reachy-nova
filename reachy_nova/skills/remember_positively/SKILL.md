# Remember Positively

Save a positive feedback package for future learning. Captures the last 2
minutes of conversation, camera frames, and audio alongside your description
of what you did right.

## Parameters
- what (string, required): What you did that was liked (e.g. "told a joke about cats")
- trigger (string, optional): What triggered the feedback (e.g. "head scratch", "verbal praise")

## Examples
- "I made them laugh with a pun" (after head scratch)
- "I recognized them and greeted them by name"
- "I helped them find information about trains"
