# Remember Negatively

Save a negative feedback package for future learning. Captures the last 2
minutes of conversation, camera frames, and audio alongside your description
of what went wrong.

## Parameters
- what (string, required): What you did that was disliked (e.g. "talked too much about a topic")
- trigger (string, optional): What triggered the feedback (e.g. "verbal correction", "told to stop")

## Examples
- "I was too loud and startled them"
- "I kept talking when they wanted silence"
- "I gave wrong information about the weather"
